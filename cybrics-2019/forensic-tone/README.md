The challenge leads us to a YouTube video of someone behind a chair typing on a phone, and the tones generated by the phone can be heard. This tone system is called [DTMF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-tone_multi-frequency_signaling). Each keypress produces a tone consisting of two simultaneous sinusoidal frequencies. Most keypresses are repeated a few times.

|        | 1209 Hz | 1336 Hz | 1477 Hz | 1633 Hz |
| ------ | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: | :-----: |
| 697 Hz |    1    |    2    |    3    |    A    |
| 770 Hz |    4    |    5    |    6    |    B    |
| 852 Hz |    7    |    8    |    9    |    C    |
| 941 Hz |    *    |    0    |    #    |    D    |

Identifying these tones simply by listening to them isn't easy (this skill is aptly called [ear training](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_training)), so let's get some help with identifying them.

First, let's save the audio into a file. The `-F` flag in `youtube-dl -F https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11k0n7TOYeM` shows us the download options.

We only want the audio, so `140` is an appropriate choice.

We can open the `.m4a` file with [Audacity](https://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/), the good old audio editor. Just go to _File_ > _Import_ > _Audio..._ and select the file. We can make the audio a bit louder by selecting the whole track (Ctrl+A) and choosing _Effect_ > _Amplify..._.

Now here's the trick: we want to identify the two simultaneous frequencies in each keypress. To do this, we select the keypress we want to identify and then we go to _Analyze_ > _Plot Spectrum..._.

![Audacity spectrum plot](spectrum.png)

This window shows the frequency analysis of the selected part of the audio. Because of noise and harmonics, other frequencies show up, but it's easy to see there are two peaks in the graph. By hovering the mouse near these peaks, we can see the frequency at the cursor position and the nearest peak frequency (1354 Hz and 1340 Hz in this image, respectively). We'll write down the peak frequencies of the two biggest peaks, which should be pretty close to the values in the table.

In the first keypress, the values are 699 Hz and 1340 Hz. The nearest values in the table are 697 Hz and 1336 Hz, which means the "2" key was pressed. It's easy to notice the same key is being pressed a few times (it's the same tone and there are longer gaps between other presses), so let's just write down how many times it was pressed and repeat this process for each group of keypresses.

In the end, you should have the following data:

`222 999 22 777 444 222 7777 7777 33 222 777 33 8 8 666 66 2 555 333 555 2 4`

If you've ever sent an SMS using a dumb phone, you probably know what to do already. Each sequence corresponds to a letter written in a telephone keypad, so 2 = A, 22 = B, 222 = C, 3 = D, 33 = E and so on. By decoding the data we have, we get the sequence `cybricssecrettonalflag`, which should be formatted as `cybrics{secrettonalflag}`.
